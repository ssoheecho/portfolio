        <b>DATA CTRL</b> is a collaborative project for the NYC Media Lab x Consumer Reports Challenge. Our team prototyped an online educational tool and chatbot to provide users information on the consequences of their data agreement and to have a single location to control their data outcomes across multiple websites. Over the course of a short dialogue, users could ask about the different components of a privacy policy and specify exactly what settings they want. The focus of the project was on user research, content design, and art direction.

      <p class="caption"><b>// USER DATA ANALYSIS</b><br><br>
        Privacy policies are long, detailed, and usually not written in plain language. And every company has their own version of a policy, so you have to opt out at every individual site. And each site has different language about the preferences you’re selecting. Even if you take the time to understand and select your desired privacy settings, it is challenging to know the consequences of opting in or out.<br><br>

        We wanted to understand how people felt about this process, so we surveyed a number of people within our academic cohort. Our cohort is primarily composed of people in the 28-35 year old range. And in general, as critical technologists, we trend negatively against corporate power.
        We tracked mean and mode responses on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is a strong disagreement and 5 is strong agreement. And we took mode to determine how a choice might have been trending.

      <p class="caption"><b>// USER FLOW & WIREFRAME</b><br><br>
        Our team wanted to focus on the flow of the experience. We designed a more welcoming conversation to introduce audiences to the concepts of information privacy and what it means to accept the terms. Instead of building the actual chatbot, we spent our time on user research, content design, and art direction.

      <p class="caption"><b>// PROTOTYPE</b><br><br>
        For our final pitch, we built out a preliminary web prototype. The website provides some introductory information about how privacy policies are set up, and how companies use your data. For example, the three types of information you create every time you go online and the three things that businesses can use your information for profit.  This intro would be an entry point for users who aren’t familiar with the typical ways companies use their data.

        Our chatbot, Deecee, would ask the user their comfort levels with different privacy settings, and explain what changing them would mean. Deecee helps users connect with the consequences of their data choices and have a single location to control their data outcomes across multiple websites. Over the course of a short dialogue, you could ask about the different components of a privacy policy, and specify exactly what settings you want.
