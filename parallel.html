        I was the <span style="background-color:#FFDAB9;">design lead for the branding and UI/UX</span> of the thesis exhibition website for the 2021 graduating classes of Parsons MFA & BFA Design and Technology. You can visit the full website <u><a href="//parsons.edu/dt" target="_blank">here</a></u>.

      <p class=caption><b>PROCESS</b></p>
      <p class=caption><b>// PROJECT ROADMAP</b><br><br>
        The project was a collaborative work between student designers, professor mentors, and an outside web developer. Since the time dedicated to the project was cut short and everything was done remotely, it was crucial that everyone had a point of reference for list of project task lists and the detailed timeline. <span style="background-color:#FFDAB9;">I created the project roadmap, delegated work based on individual skills, and set soft and hard deadlines to meet the goals of our team and the overall exhibition planning committee.</span>

      <p class=caption><b>// INITIAL ITERATIONS</b><br><br>
        Our work began with a survey of potential show titles. After collecting feedback from our cohort, <span style="background-color:#FFDAB9;">we started developing the show's visual identity around two potential show titles: PARALLEL and UNWINDING.</span> After creating a series of visual identity samples, we asked our cohort to vote for their favorite and came to an agreement with PARALLEL design #2.

      <p class=caption><b>// BRANDING</b><br><br>
        <span style="background-color:#FFDAB9;">We focused the branding on the glitch aesthetic as it spoke to our shared experiences as a collective of students operating in a remote setting.</span> The two-column layout was created to further embody the concept of 'parallel' in our design. We created a branding guideline by narrowing down on the conceptual direction, typeface options, and color palette. The guideline was used by the publication, promo, and symposium teams for their respective assets.

      <p class=caption><b>// MOCKUPS</b><br><br>
        After creating the visual identity of the show, <span style="background-color:#FFDAB9;">we produced both low and high-fidelity mockups of desktop and mobile UI/UX mockups</span> to hand off for web development. The mockups were done in Figma.
