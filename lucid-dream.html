        Born out of a memory from when I was younger, <b>lucid dream</b> recreates a dream sequence where I was surrounded by little rubber fish floating around in a museum room. Built in Unity and overlaid with text from Ezra and Miriam Elia’s book, We Go to the Gallery, the project captures the vivid surreal visuals.<br><br>

      <img src="assets/lucid-dream/lucid_01.png" alt="an image from the first scene of the video where the player is standing in front of a James Turell inspired room. The text overlay reads, 'There is nothing in the room. John is confused. Susan is confused. Mummy is happy. There is nothing in the room because God is dead, says Mummy. Oh Dear, says John.'">
      <img src="assets/lucid-dream/lucid_02.png" alt="an image from middle of the video where the player is standing in front of Dan Flavin inspired light sculpture. The text overlay reads, 'Is the art pretty? says Susan. No says Mummy. Pretty is not important.'">
      <img src="assets/lucid-dream/lucid_03.png" alt="an image from the middle of the room where the player is looking slightly up towards the ceiling. There are floating rubber fish in the middle of a gallery. On the left is an antique vase and on the right is a painting by Lee Krasner. In front, there is a Dan Flavin inspired light sculpture.">
